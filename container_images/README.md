# Docker container images

The source for Docker container images used in our CI/CD infrastructure. Each
folder represents one image. These are built by [Kaniko] jobs in our Concourse
`container-build` pipeline and generally published on gcr.io container registry,
but are not made publicly available.

We use these in [Prow] jobs and [Concourse] pipelines. Concourse pipelines are
located in the [concourse](../concourse/) directory. Prow jobs are configured in
the [oss-test-infra] repository.
